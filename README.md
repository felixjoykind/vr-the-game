A game I've made for an olc_code_jam back in 2021.

# Description
VR is a game about a boy from 3021. In his time humanity have invented a VR technology that allows to edit the world. Unfortunately, this technology is not perfect yet, so it has limited time to use and limited number of virtual blocks that you can place.

Discover technology from future! Help main character to pass all 5 levels! And the most important - Have Fun!

# Controls
__A - left, D - right, W - jump, X - enter VR mode and LEFT mouse click to place virtual blocks, ESC - pause.__
